**Author**: Erik Savage, Andrew Enyeart
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
Create a small app to track what books have impacted you, and what’s recommended to read next.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

### Team Agreement
**Logistical**
- Communication Hours: 12:00 - 9:00pm pertaining to project
- Communication Preferences: Slack/Remo
- How often will you take breaks? Once per hour min.
- Plan if behind: Extend working hours to 12am or as needed

**Cooperative**
- Make a list of each person’s strengths.
  - Andrew - Thinking through implementation, solutions, and debugging
  - Erik - Staying on Task (MVP), JavaScript, React, BootStrap, Components
- How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application? 
  - Support one another through partner programming.
- In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
  - Andrew - keeping focused on the MVP, React-Bootstrap, remembering important steps for backend
  - Erik - Bootstrap CSS, and more practice with Backend
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
  - Switch Driver/Navigator roles every 1 hour, if too burdensome this will be reduced to every 2 hours.

**Conflict Resolution**
- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
  - Have an open conversation with each other, escalate only as needed.
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
  - Have an open conversation with each other first, escalate only as needed.
- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  - Patience and mentoring others on skills they don’t understand. Recognizing that occasionally it will simply be necessary to lean a little more on one person’s strengths
